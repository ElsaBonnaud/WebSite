{{< figure src="/3.jpg#floatleft" >}}I’m an **Assistant Professor** at **Paris Saclay University** since 2011.

I obtained a MSc in Biology and Ecology and a PhD in **Ecology and population dynamics**. My main research areas are focused on *predator-prey dynamics*, *invasive species*, *disturbed ecosystems*, *biotic interactions* and *biological conservation*.
</div>

I'm currently working on the **impact of predators** both on **insular ecosystems** and **peri-urban areas** to understand how global changes can induce disturbances in **predator-prey interactions**.

I have co-supervised **1 post-doc**, **3 PhD students**. I am **responsible of 2 teaching units** and currently involved in  research programs regarding **predator-prey regulation disruption** that can lead to agricultural issues.

I'm a **Scientific Expert** for **the national Park of Port-Cros** & for **the Small Mediterranean Island International Initiative**.
