Iâ€™m an Assistant Professor at Paris south University since 2011. I obtained a MSc in Biology and Ecology and a PhD in Ecology and Population dynamics. My main research areas are focused on predator-prey dynamics, invasive species, disturbed ecosystems, biotic interactions and biological conservation. I am currently working on the impact of predators both on insular ecosystems and peri-urban areas to understand how global changes can induce disturbances in predator-prey interactions. I have co-supervised 1 post-doc, 2 PhD students. I am responsible of 2 teaching units and involved in applied research programs regarding overabundant species that can lead to agricultural issues.
